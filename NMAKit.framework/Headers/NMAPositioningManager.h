 * \class NMAPositioningManager NMAPositioningManager.h "NMAPositioningManager.h"
 *
 * \brief Manages positioning services for the NMA SDK.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a singleton class and thus should never be retained, released, or
 * instantiated. The singleton instance is accessed via the
 * sharedPositioningManager method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the startPositioning method to begin tracking position, and stopPositioning
 * to stop. By default, position data comes from an instance of NMADevicePositionSource,
 * which uses CLLocationManager to determine position. Any custom source of position
 * data can be used instead by subclassing NMAPositionDataSource and installing an
 * instance of the subclass in the NMAPositioningManager dataSource property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Two types of position are available from the positioning manager: the raw position
 * and the map-matched position. The raw position is simply passed straight through from
 * the positioning manager's data source. The map-matched position is the estimated position
 * on the road network based on the raw position input. When either type of position changes,
 * a NMAPositioningManagerDidUpdatePositionNotification will be sent out. If the raw position
 * is lost, a NMAPositioningManagerDidLosePositionNotification is sent.
 * </p>
 *
 * \note Certain other SDK features may require the use of the positioning manager;
 * if these features are accessed, the positioning manager will be enabled
 * automatically (for example, the NMAPositionIndicator of a NMAMapView).
 *
 * \note NMAPositioningManager requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * NMAApplicationContext. If valid credentials are not present the API may not
 * function correctly or may stop functioning correctly in the future when server
 * side configurations change.
