 * \brief The interface used to create a custom position source for NMAPositioningManager.
 *
 * Custom position data sources are used in conjunction with NMAPositioningManager to
 * provide position data to the application. To broadcast position updates, a source should
 * created and installed on the NMAPositioningManager using its dataSource property. When a
 * source has a new position available (or it determines the current postion is unknown 
 * because a position/GPS fix has been lost), it calls the dataSourceDidUpdatePosition:
 * method of NMAPositioningManager. The positioning manager then uses the currentPosition
 * method of the data source to retrieve the updated position.
