/**
 * \class NMAGeocoder NMAGeocoder.h "NMAGeocoder.h"
 *
 * \brief Represents a factory used to instantiate geocoder requests.
 * <p>
 * A %NMAGeocoder enables searching for location data by way of the following
 * search services:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Structured Address Geocode - matches a NMAAddress to its correct
 *     NMAPlaceLocation on the map (its latitude and longitude).</li>
 * <li>One box Geocode - matches a free text query (and location context) to
 *     its correct NMAPlaceLocation on the map (its latitude and longitude).</li>
 * <li>Reverse Geocode - retrieves a NMAPlaceLocation
 *     based on a given NMAGeoCoordinates.</li></ul></p>
 *
 * \note NMAGeocoder requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * NMAApplicationContext. If valid credentials are not present an attempt to
 * call sharedNMAGeocoder will result in a runtime assert.
