/**
 * \class NMAMapLoader NMAMapLoader.h "NMAMapLoader.h"
 *
 * \brief Provides various methods which facilitate usage of offline map data
 * capabilities. Calls made to NMAMapLoader are asynchronous and return results
 * through the {@link NMAMapLoaderDelegate} interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>Usage</p>
 * <p>
 * The NMAMapLoader may only perform a single operation at a time. Therefore,
 * if a method is called before the callback for a previous method call has been
 * made, the call will fail and return NO.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Incremental Updates</p>
 * <p>
 * All map data downloaded by the client application has a version. This includes
 * data downloaded through the NMAMapLoader and data downloaded automatically as
 * a result of map browsing. At any given time, all cached map data has the same
 * version.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Periodically, new versions of the map database are released. To ensure that
 * the client application is always using the freshest map data available, the
 * map cache should be updated regularly. This is accomplished by first calling
 * -checkForMapDataUpdate. If an update is available, it can be performed by
 * calling -performMapDataUpdate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When map data is updated, only the differences between the current version
 * and the new version need to be downloaded. These "incremental updates" allow
 * the map data to be kept up to date without having to delete and re-download
 * the entire map cache every time. Thus, the size of a map data update is
 * typically much smaller than the size of the cache itself.
 * </p>
 *
 * \note NMAMapLoader is a singleton which must be obtained using the
 * {@link sharedMapLoader} method.
 *
 * \note NMAMapLoader requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * NMAApplicationContext. If valid credentials are not present the API may not
 * function correctly or may stop functioning correctly in the future when server
 * side configurations change.
