 * \brief A container of NMAMapObject instances, containers can be added to a NMAMapView
 * instance.
 *
 * <p>Applications can, as necessary, add or remove certain
 * types of %NMAMapObject objects to or from a %NMAMapContainer (refer to
 * \link addMapObject:\endlink for details). A %NMAMapContainer is also
 * useful for grouping together %NMAMapObject objects to allow application operations
 * on entire groups of map objects without requiring an iterative approach to
 * inspecting or changing the state of each individual %NMAMapObject (e.g. for changing
 * their visibility).</p>
 *
 * \note The zOrder of an NMAMapObject instance in a container is relative only to other
 * NMAMapObject instances within the same container. Note that containers are derived
 * from NMAMapObject also have zOrder.
