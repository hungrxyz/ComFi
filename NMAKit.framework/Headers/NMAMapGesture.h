 * \brief Delegate protocol for map gesture handling.
 * <p>
 * This protocol should be implemented by any class which acts as the gesture delegate for a map view
 * or any map subview which needs to receive gestures from the map view.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a gesture is detected by the map view, the following steps are taken:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The map checks whether a suitable subview can be found to handle the gesture (see below)</li>
 * <li> If a suitable subview is found, the gesture is passed to it and the map takes no further action </li>
 * <li> If a subview is not found, the NMAMapView's gestureDelegate is checked if present to see if it
 *  can handle the gesture type in question </li>
 * <li> The gesture is passed to the delegate if it can handle it, and the map takes no further action </li>
 * <li> Finally, if the gesture is still not handled, the NMAMapView takes the default action
   (e.g. panning, zooming, etc. depending on the type of gesture received)</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * In order for a map subview to accept a gesture which originates inside it, three conditions must
 * be met: the view must be visible, it must implement the %NMAMapGestureDelegate protocol, and it
 * must implement the specific gesture handling method for the type of gesture in question.
 * If a gesture hits a subview which cannot handle it, the NMAMApView will perform the same
 * check on that view's superview. The view hierarchy is ascended in this manner until either the
 * gesture is accepted or the NMAMapView itself is reached. Note that a subview using the
 * NMAMapGestureDelegate protocol may implement any or all of the gesture handling methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The NMAMapView may optionally be provided with a gesture delegate, set via the gestureDelegate
 * property. This delegate can be used to modify how the NMAMapView responds to some or all of
 * its recognized gestures. The delegate class must implement the NMAMapGestureDelegate protocol;
 * however, it need not implement all of the gesture handling methods. For any methods not
 * implemented, the default behaviour will be used when that type of gesture is received. If
 * specialized gesture behaviour is desired <em>in addition</em> to the default behaviour, then
 * the custom gesture handling method should invoke the implementation of that handling method
 * on the map view's default gesture handler, accessed via the defaultGestureHandler property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, to add behaviour when the map receives a tap, the delegate class implementation
 * of the NMAMapGestureDelegate protocol method mapView:(NMAMapView*)mapView didReceiveTapAtLocation:
 * could have the following form:
 *
 * \code
   -(void)mapView:(NMAMapView*)mapView didReceiveTapAtLocation:(CGPoint)location
   {
     // Some custom tap behaviour
     // ...

     [mapView.defaultGestureHandler mapView:mapView didReceiveTapAtLocation:location];  // optional

     // More custom tap behaviour
     // ...
   }
   \endcode
 *
 * \note Methods of this protocol will be called on the main queue.
