/**
 * A singleton class used to perform search requests for custom locations.

 * application may search for and retrieve these custom locations, which can then be used
 * to supplement the places provided by standard Here searches, or for any other purpose
 * required by the application.
 *
 * The NMACustomLocationManager provides several methods for requesting custom locations.
 * Locations may be searched around a posiiton, inside a bounding box, along a route, and
 * more. Additional search parameters may be provided to filter the results, including
 * a layer ID, search radius, text query, and custom attributes.
 *
 * The results of search requests are packaged in an NMACustomLocationResponse object, which
 * is passed to the completion block provided to the request method. If there is an error
 * with the request, a request object is also passed to the completion block. Requests are
 * performed asynchronously, and may be executed simultaneously.
