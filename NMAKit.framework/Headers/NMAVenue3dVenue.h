/**
 * \class NMAVenue3dVenue NMAVenue3dVenue.h "NMAVenue3dVenue.h"
 *
 * \brief NMAVenue3dVenue represents a public building or a group of public buildings in a map.
 *
 * Examples of public buildings are shopping malls and airports. Venues are displayed or hidden depending on map location.
 * <p>
 * A NMAVenue3dVenue object consists of one or more NMAVenue3dLevel objects. NMAVenue3dLevel, in turn,
 * consists of one or more NMAVenue3dOuterArea objects. NMAVenue3dOuterArea represents a physical form of
 * an outer area of certain level in the building. An NMAVenue3dOuterArea typically contains NMAVenue3dSpace
 * objects that represent, for example, single shops inside the venue.
 * </p>
 *
 * \note NMAVenue3dVenue cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it can be obtained by calling
 * \link NMAVenue3dController::venue\endlink or
 * \link NMAVenue3dServiceListener::venueService:didGetVenue:\endlink
 * callback.
