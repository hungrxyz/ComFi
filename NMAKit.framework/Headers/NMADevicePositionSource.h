 * NMADevicePositionSource provides basic usage of CLLocationManager to the
 * NMAPositioningManager. The properties of the CLLocationManager instance may be
 * customized as needed, otherwise the default values are used.
 *
 * \note More advanced usage of CLLocationManager may be achieved by subclassing
 * NMADevicePositionSource. Any of the %CLLocationManagerDelegate methods may be
 * freely implemented, except locationManager:didUpdateLocations: and
 * locationManager:didFailWithError:. If either of these methods is implemented,
 * the superclass method should be invoked at some point in the subclass implementation.
