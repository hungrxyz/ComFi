 * <p>
 * NMARouteManagerDelegate is used to monitor route calculation progress and
 * route calculation completion. Set the NMARouteManager delegate property
 * in order to receive callbacks through NMARouteManagerDelegate protocol.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The current status of the NMARouteManager can be checked via the busy property.
 * </p>
 * <p>NMARouteManager only supports one routing request at a time. Attempts
 * to make another request before the current request has finished will fail.</p>
 *
 * <p>NMARouteManager requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * NMAApplicationContext. If valid credentials are not present the API may not
 * function correctly or may stop functioning correctly in the future when server
 * side configurations change.</p>
 *
 * <p>Routing within China is supported, but routes may not cross the Chinese border.
 * Thus, any route calculation which begins, ends, or passes through China and involves
 * one or more other countries will fail.</p>
 *
 * \note It is possible for an NMARouteManager request to return a route that can't be
 * followed; for example, a route that is blocked by a traffic accident or construction
 * work. These conditions will likely be reported if the traffic feature is available
 * and enabled for routing, but they may not be in all cases. Appropriate caution should
 * always be exercised when using routes provided by NMARouteManager.
 *
 * \deprecated This is deprecated since release 3.2. Use an %NMARouter subclass.
