/**
 * \class NMAPlaces NMAPlaces.h "NMAPlaces.h"
 *
 * Represents a factory for creating places requests.
 *
 * <p>
 * The %NMAPlaces service supports a variety of use cases that center
 * around two major features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Place discovery - helps users find places that are relevant to them.</li>
 * <li>Place information retrieval - provides detailed information about places
 *     in which users are interested.</li></ul></p>
 * <p>
 * For place discovery, the %NMAPlaces API supports two use cases from which
 * to choose according to the requirements for the application:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Search - finds places that match user-provided search terms.</li>
 * <li>Explore - guides users to relevant places nearby.</li></ul></p>
 * <p>
 * The %NMAPlaces API defines resources that represent entry points for
 * supported use cases, employing links to describe the application flow within
 * a particular use case.</p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the discovery request is an entry point to the %NMAPlaces
 * API resource. When an application user submits a discovery request to the
 * search resource, the response contains, among other items, a list of links
 * to places or to place resources. Each referenced place might have rich
 * content associated with it, including ratings, images, reviews, editorials,
 * and owner content. Each place also contains references to related places, which
 * allow users to discover places relevant to or otherwise related to their
 * original search.</p>
 *
 * \note NMAPlaces requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * NMAApplicationContext. If valid credentials are not present the API may not
 * function correctly or may stop functioning correctly in the future when server
 * side configurations change.
