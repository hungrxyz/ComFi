 * <li>BMP, SVG, JPEG and PNG data formats are supported</li>
 * <li>SVG Tiny 1.1 is supported</li>
 * <li>BMP data format support is limited to either standard BMP v3 with 24/32

 * 24/32 bits per pixel plus bitfields compression and A8R8G8B8 pixel formatting</li>
 * <li>Only basic parsing of the BMP header is done, while gamma correction and
 * color profile information is ignored</li></ul></p>

 * \note PNG compression may be enabled by default in Xcode; files compressed this

/**
 * \brief Constructs a NMAImage from a UIImage.
 *
 * When converting a UIImage to an NMAImage, the scale of the original image is compared
 * against the scale of the device. If they are different, the image is resized so that
 * the scale of the final image is the same as the device scale.
 *
 * For example, if a 100x100 pixel UIImage with a scale of 2x is converted to an NMAImage
 * on a 3x scale device, the NMAImage will have dimensions of 150x150 (and an implicit
 * scale of 3x to match the device).
