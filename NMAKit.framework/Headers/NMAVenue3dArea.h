 *
 * \brief An NMAVenue3dArea object conceptually represents a physical area within a NMAVenue3dVenue.

 * The area can be of either NMAVenue3dOuterArea or NMAVenue3dSpace type, which both have a bounding box and
 * center coordinates. The NMAVenue3dArea class encapsulates these parameters.
 * <p>
 * This class can not be instantiated directly. Subclasses NMAVenue3dOuterArea and NMAVenue3dSpace can be
 * obtained by methods of NMAVenue3dLevel.
